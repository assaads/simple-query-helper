# TypeScript Error Resolution Plan

## Main Task
Resolve all TypeScript errors and ESLint warnings in the workspace to ensure type safety and code quality.

## Context & Guidelines
- Project uses TypeScript with React
- Several missing module dependencies identified
- Type definition issues across multiple components
- Some ESLint warnings about component exports and hooks
- CSS warnings related to Tailwind directives

## Files to Monitor
1. src/lib/supabase.ts
   - Missing mockAuth export issue
2. src/pages/Agent.tsx
   - Multiple type errors and missing module
3. src/pages/Settings.tsx
   - Type definition issues
4. src/services/knowledgeBaseService.ts
   - Property 'from' missing issues
5. src/services/sessionService.ts
   - Property 'from' missing issues
6. Multiple UI components with missing dependencies
   - date-fns
   - class-variance-authority
   - @radix-ui/react-label
   - react-hook-form

## Files to Create
No new files needed, focus on fixing existing files

## Files to Delete
None

## Subtasks

1. ✅ Install Missing Dependencies
   - Files affected: package.json
   - Completed: Installed uuid, date-fns, class-variance-authority, @radix-ui/react-label, react-hook-form and @types/uuid
   - Dependencies successfully added to package.json and lock file

2. ✅ Fix Supabase and Auth Issues
   - Files affected: src/lib/supabase.ts, src/lib/mockAuth.ts
   - Completed: Fixed mockAuth exports and imports
   - Added proper type definitions for mock client
   - Verified Supabase client configuration

3. ✅ Fix Agent Component Issues (Partially Complete)
   - Fixed most type definitions and imports
   - Updated props and hooks usage
   - Added proper Step type handling
   - Remaining issue: Message type mismatch between agentTypes and chatTypes

4. Fix Service Layer Issues
   - Files affected: 
     - src/services/knowledgeBaseService.ts
     - src/services/sessionService.ts
   - Add proper Supabase client typing
   - Fix 'from' property issues

5. Fix Settings Component
   - Files affected: src/pages/Settings.tsx
   - Fix ApiKeyService import
   - Resolve prop type issues

6. Fix UI Component Issues
   - Files affected: Multiple UI components
   - Resolve type definitions
   - Fix ESLint warnings about component exports
   - Address fast refresh warnings

7. Fix CSS Warnings
   - Files affected: src/index.css
   - Verify Tailwind configuration
   - Address unknown @ rule warnings

## Verification Strategy
- After each subtask, run TypeScript compiler to verify error resolution
- Check ESLint output for remaining warnings
- Verify components render correctly
- Ensure no new type errors are introduced
- Test affected functionality

The task requires careful attention to dependencies and type definitions. We'll need to proceed step by step to ensure each fix doesn't introduce new issues.
